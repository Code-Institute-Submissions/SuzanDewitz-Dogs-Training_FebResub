            <hr>
            <p>a truth universally acknowledged that dogs are human best friend.
                But have you ever stopped to wonder why it is that pooches enjoy our company so much? Just why are dogs friendly to humans?
                Our history with canines stretches millennia, to the time when they were basically wolves.

                <p> many of us remain unaware of the physical and mental health benefits that can also accompany the pleasure of snuggling up to a furry friend.
                    It's no secret that pets can contribute to your happiness. Studies show that dogs reduce stress, anxiety and depression; ease loneliness75%

      <h2>Social contact <i class="fas fa-paw"></i></h2>
      <hr>
      <p>When we talk about being more active social contact, I have found that having a dog also helps in being more social. When I walk Bowie, 
        I always interact with other dog owners (or dog lovers) on the street whether it is a quick hello or a longer conversation.

        <h2>Get you active <i class="fas fa-dog"></i></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>As a dog-owner, you are bound to take daily walks with your pooch and I love the fact that Bowie is a constant reminder in my life to get out for a walk and some fresh air.
          If I forget to do so, he comes over and puts his paw on my leg to tell me its time. For me, these walks are great not only for keeping fit,
          but also for my creative process.
