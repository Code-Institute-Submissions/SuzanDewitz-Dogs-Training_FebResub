                        <p>The truth universally acknowledged that dogs are human best friend.
                            But have you ever stopped to wonder why it is that pooches enjoy our company so much? Just why are dogs friendly to humans?
                            Our history with canines stretches millennia, to the time when they were basically wolves.

                            the door so that you know if there is a possible danger. 
                           Some will also attack if they feel that you or a family member is in danger to try and protect you.
