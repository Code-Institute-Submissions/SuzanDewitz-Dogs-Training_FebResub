* The padding of 20px provides a comfortable amount of space between the content and the border. 
* The background color (#1e3e48) is a dark blue-gray, creating a calm and sophisticated atmosphere. 
* The border-radius of 800px gives the elements a soft, rounded edge, adding to the overall aesthetic. 
* The box-shadow with a 3px offset in #888888 provides a subtle, three-dimensional effect that adds depth to the elements. Finally, the text color of #ffffff (white) provides high contrast against the dark background and makes the text easy to read.

 #### LIGHTHOUSE

<br>

  + I have been working on lighthouse proformas for the past few weeks and I have gained a good understanding of the concept. <br>However, I have encountered a challenge with the image size. The images I have used are not of the required size, which has affected the quality of my proformas.

   + Despite this issue, I have been actively working to improve my skills in lighthouse proformas. I have been reading relevant articles, <br>watching tutorials and practicing on my own. I have also been seeking feedback from my colleagues and making changes based on their suggestions.Going forward, <br>I plan to take the following steps to resolve the issue with the image size:
  
   - Research and understand the recommended image size for lighthouse proformas.
   - Implement the recommended size in my work going forward.
   - Seek feedback from colleagues and make any necessary changes to improve the quality of my proformas.
   - In conclusion, I am committed to improving my skills in lighthouse proformas and resolving the issue with the image size. <br>I believe that with continued learning and practice, 
   I will be able to produce high-quality proformas in the future.
   - The reason I say b/c in  different screen sizes I am getting different proformas lighthouse result

 #### ACCESSIBILITY


## SOLVED BUGS AND ERRORS

# BUGS 
+ contact.html  an extra "</div>" end tag in your code, which is causing an error. A "stray end tag" error occurs when an HTML end tag does not have a matching start tag.
I resolve this issue, by removing the extra "</div>".

+ index.html Another error message is indicating that the "for" attribute of the "label" element is set to "map", which is the ID of the "iframe" element. I ensures that the label is properly associated with the form control (in this case, the map). 

+ index.html Another error message is indicating that the "section" element is lacking a heading. i improve accessibility and make the content more structured, it's also recommended to add an appropriate heading (e.g. <h2>, <h3>, etc.) to the section. If the section doesn't need a heading, consider using a <div> element instead of a <section> element.in this case i add h2 element the error was solve
